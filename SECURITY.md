# Security Policy

## Report Vunerabilities

Please create a GitHub issue to report any vunerabilities. If the issue is critical or sensitive then ask to chat privately and I will coordinate a way to do so via private message or a GitHub [security advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories).

## Security Audits

No offical security audits have been conducted on this codebase yet. Use at your own risk.

With that said, steps were taken to following best practises for encryption and systems security from NIST:

## Intro

A simple web app to securely encrypt and decrypt QR codes used for two-factor authentication. Safely store encrypted QR codes in your photo gallery or print them out.

- **Secure Backups:** Encrypted QR code images can be saved anywhere or printed out to recover accounts if your 2FA device is lost.
- **Privacy Focused:** No data is collected about you and all QR code scanning, encryption, and decryption is done on your device.
- **Advanced Security:** Encryption uses AES-GCM and PBKDF2 with a salted 256-bit key. View the process in Typescript or Python.
- **MIT Open Source:** Review the code and reuse it however you like. Self-host or run the site locally for fully offline encryption.

## Develop

Install and run (pnpm, yarn, and bun should work too). Access on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Start at the landing page `app/page.tsx` and start playing. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Deploy

Test and deploy with:

```bash
npm run check
npm run build
```
